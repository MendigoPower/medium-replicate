			<h2>Forget Generations X, Y and Z: Let’s Label People by Presidents</h2>
			<h3>What President were you born under?</h3>
			<img src="images/article.jpeg" alt="Main Article">
			<p> 
				In the wake of the release of Chuck Klosterman’s terrific book The Nineties, there has been an influx of discussion of Generation X, and how that generation differs from Generations Y, and Z, and Millennials, and Boomers, and whatever other names are floating around that I don’t know about yet. But I do sometimes wonder if having such broad labels spanning decades of time is slicing the bread too thick. I wonder, if on this President’s Day, we should think of this as a matter of Presidents.</p>

				<p>Specifically: Who was President were you born? It’s either a four-or-eight-year stretch, and it gives us much clearer, more specific spans of time to deal with. I think you can tell much more about a person by which President’s term they were born under than what “generation” they are. Let’s give it a try.</p>

					<p>Biden Babies (Born January 2021-present). These people are literal babies. They have existed only in a pandemic. They’re still shitting in their pants. It’s probably fair to say we don’t know much about these kids yet, except that someday their parents will tell their grandchildren how freaking crazy it was to have a baby in a pandemic.</p>

					<p>Trump Babies (Born January 2017-January 2021). The oldest of these kids is still only five years old, so we don’t know a lot about them yet either. Though we do know a lot of them spent kindergarten staring at a computer screen. Also: When future generations look back at this period and think, “wait, that guy was President?” the kids born during this time will be like, “yeah, and I was born during that time! I can’t believe I survived.” I can’t believe any of us did, kid.</p>

					<p>Obama Babies (Born January 2009-January 2017). This group, which includes both my 10-year-old son and my seven-year-old son, just minted its first teenagers. I know that 2009 is only 13 years ago, but considering the seismic changes our culture and our technology have gone through in that time, they might as well been born in the 1920s. I do suspect this is the generation, out of all of these, that is, in 50 years, most proud of the President they were born under.</p>

					<p>Dubya Babies (Born January 2001-January 2009). These are now legal adults and, come this month, some of them (unlike Dubya) will be legally drinking. This is of course the September 11 generation, people who only know life during the 20-year panic attack our country has been having since the Towers fell. If any of these kids were to read The Nineties, it would feel essentially like reading about the Civil War.</p>

					<p>Clinton Babies (Born January 1993-January 2001). Check it out, millennials: You’re all about to turn 30. Suck on that. Have you noticed how you’re drifting out of the target demo now? Welcome to our world. If you were born at in the first term of the Clinton administration, you are now old enough to run for the House of Representatives. Madison Cawthorne, born in 1995, actually is in the House, though only officially.</p>

					<p>George H.W. Babies (Born January 1989-January 1993). These are the last people to live in the wake of the cold war, and also the ones who never saw Phil Hartman on “Saturday Night Live.” They all were the first ones to have email addresses in high school, which is to say, they might be the last kids to remember life before them.
					Reagan Babies (Born January 1981-January 1989). If you were in the second or third grade and had to do drills where you got under your desk because someone had launched a nuclear weapon, you might be a Reagan baby. Also, you people are all about to turn 40, which is to say everyone is about to stop caring what you think too.</p>

					<p>Trump Babies (Born January 2017-January 2021). The oldest of these kids is still only five years old, so we don’t know a lot about them yet either. Though we do know a lot of them spent kindergarten staring at a computer screen.
